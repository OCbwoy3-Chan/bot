# Privacy Policy

**Revision #3 – Effective Date:** July 22, 2025

We believe in keeping your information private, as it's a fundamental human right. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect your information when you use our service (the “Bot” or “Service”).

## 1. What We Collect

We collect only what’s necessary to make OCbwoy3‑Chan work:

* **Discord User IDs:**
  Used for moderation logs, AI memory, and account linking.

* **Roblox User IDs:**
  Collected as part of a private account linking system.

* **Chat Messages:**
  Processed temporarily via Google’s Gemini AI Model. Messages may appear in live logs (`stdout`), but we do not store them long-term unless needed for moderation or legal reasons.

---

## 2. Why We Collect Data

We collect data solely to operate and improve the Service:

* To generate AI responses.
* To support our whitelist system allowing certain users to access or use specific features of the bot.
* To support moderation in Roblox and external communities.

---

## 3. How We Share Your Data

* **We never sell your data.**
* **Public Data:** Some data, like whitelist, ban status, OCbwoy3's Discord Status, may be public through bot commands or API endpoints.
* **Private Data:** Accessible only to you, the bot owners, authorized administrators, and law enforcement when legally required.

---

## 4. How Long We Keep Data

* **Moderation and GBan Records:** Kept until removed by moderators, administrators, or after a ban expires. Retained longer when needed for investigations or legal reasons.
* **Law Enforcement Requests:** We comply with lawful data requests.
* **Chat Logs:** Appear only in runtime output and are not permanently stored, unless retained for debugging, moderation, or legal needs.
* **AI Memories:** Stored until manually deleted or retention is legally required.

---

## 5. How We Protect Your Data

We apply technical and organizational safeguards to help protect your data. While no system can guarantee absolute security, we work to keep your information safe.

---

## 6. Your Privacy Rights

You control your data. You can request access, corrections, or deletion at any time. Simply contact the bot owner via Discord or email.

---

## 7. Updates to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy without prior notice. Continued use of the Service means you accept the latest version.

---

## 8. Concerns

For privacy-related disputes, we prioritize resolving issues informally via Discord direct messages. If necessary, formal action will follow Latvian or EU law.

---

## 9. Legal Jurisdiction

Our handling of your data is governed by the laws of the Republic of Latvia and the European Union, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

---

## 10. International Data Transfers

Some data collected through OCbwoy3-Chan (such as chat messages processed by Google's Gemini AI Model) may be transmitted to servers outside the European Union, including to the United States or other jurisdictions where data protection laws may differ from those in the EU.

By using the Service, you consent to the transfer, processing, and storage of your data outside of your country of residence, including to jurisdictions that may not provide the same level of data protection as your local laws.

Where required under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), we rely on appropriate safeguards for data transfers, such as:

* Data processing agreements (DPAs) with subprocessors like Google LLC;
* Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission.

---

## 11. Limited Application of EU Privacy Rights

If you are not a legal resident or citizen of a European Union member state, we are not obligated to extend GDPR-level data rights (such as the right to erasure, portability, or objection) to you. While we may honor data requests at our discretion, only users protected under EU law are guaranteed these rights.

By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept that your privacy rights are determined according to your jurisdiction’s applicable laws, and not by EU regulations unless explicitly required.

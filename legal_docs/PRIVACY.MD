# Privacy Policy

**Revision #2 – Effective Date:** July 16, 2025

We believe in keeping your information private, as it's a fundamental human right. This Privacy Policy explains what we collect, why we collect it, and how we protect your information when you use our service (the “Bot” or “Service”).

## 1. What We Collect

We collect only what’s necessary to make OCbwoy3‑Chan work:

* **Discord User IDs:**
  Used for moderation logs, AI memory, and account linking.

* **Roblox User IDs:**
  Collected as part of a private account linking system.

* **Chat Messages:**
  Processed temporarily via Google’s Gemini AI Model. Messages may appear in live logs (`stdout`), but we do not store them long-term unless needed for moderation or legal reasons.

## 2. Why We Collect Data

We collect data solely to operate and improve the Service:

* To generate AI responses.
* To support our whitelist system allowing certain users to access or use specific features of the bot.
* To support moderation in Roblox and external communities.

## 3. How We Share Your Data

* **We never sell your data.**
* **Public Data:** Some data, like whitelist, ban status, OCbwoy3's Discord Status, may be public through bot commands or API endpoints.
* **Private Data:** Accessible only to you, the bot owners, authorized administrators, and law enforcement when legally required.

## 4. How Long We Keep Data

* **Moderation and GBan Records:** Kept until removed by moderators, administrators, or after a ban expires. Retained longer when needed for investigations or legal reasons.
* **Law Enforcement Requests:** We comply with lawful data requests.
* **Chat Logs:** Appear only in runtime output and are not permanently stored, unless retained for debugging, moderation, or legal needs.
* **AI Memories:** Stored until manually deleted or retention is legally required.

You control your data. You can request access, corrections, or deletion at any time. Simply contact the bot owner via Discord or email.

## 8. Concerns

For privacy-related disputes, we prioritize resolving issues informally via Discord direct messages. If necessary, formal action will follow Latvian or EU law.

Discord API data may also be stored temporarily in memory caches managed by JavaScript libraries we use, such as `discord.js` and `sapphirejs`.

The following Discord API data is publicly accessible to third parties:

* OCbwoy3's Discord Status → [https://api.ocbwoy3.dev/ocbwoy3/rpc.json](https://api.ocbwoy3.dev/ocbwoy3/rpc.json)

Additionally, some Discord API data may be transmitted to Google's servers as part of `CurrentContext` or tool call responses (e.g., `discord.get_user`, `discord.search_members`, etc.).

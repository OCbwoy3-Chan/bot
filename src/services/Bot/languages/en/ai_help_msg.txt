# OCbwoy3-Chan
**This is an experimental AI chatbot built for assisting users Discord.**
I am built on Google's Gemini API and can generate content from text, audio, video and code.

OCbwoy3-Chan will become more helpful as you chat, picking up on details and preferences to tailor its responses to your needs and selected character, similar to ChatGPT.

**To understand what OCbwoy3-Chan remembers or teach it something new, just ask it:**
- “Remember that I like concise responses.”
- “My favourite song is Next Floor It!” //* @ocbwoy3: don't change the song name (this comment is not shown in the final output)
- “What do you remember about me?”
- “What's my favourite song?”

Sometimes OCbwoy3-Chan would not save something, so asking it to do so would most likely work. If the AI updates it's memories, you would see a reaction with the :notebook: emoji.

**OCbwoy3-Chan can also use a variety of tools, such as**
- Searching [DuckDuckGo](<https://duckduckgo.com>),
- Querying data from Bluesky with the [AT Protocol](<https://atproto.com>),
- Utilizing Roblox's APIs,
- Fetching GBans (global bans),
- Looking up pages on [Fandom](<https://fandom.com>),
- Scraping websites with [Playwright](<https://playwright.dev>),
- and much more..

OCbwoy3-Chan can also roleplay as specific preset characters via the `/ai set_character` command.

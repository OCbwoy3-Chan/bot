Global Ban Handler for Script Builders.
You can ban players here. Games who use your instance of this will ban sync your bans with theirs. If they're banned in your list, all games using it will not let the user join the server. Self explanatory, really.

**NOTE: People can access ALL of your GBans by accessing the `/banland.json` endpoint! It's all public!**

**How this would look like on [ocbwoy3.dev](https://ocbwoy3.dev/lookup?u=OCboy3)**:

If you are developing/using this on NixOS, if Prisma doesn't work, Install [direnv](https://direnv.net/docs/hook.html) and then re-open the shell and run `direnv allow` (or just run the shell with `steam-run`).
